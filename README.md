# <Weather Dashboard>

## Description

Uses the OpenWeather API to create a simple weather app. Users can input a city and get current weather data for that city as well as a five-day forecast. Weather/forecast data includes temperatures, wind speeds, humidity, and general cloudiness/precipitation conditions. Previously searched cities are saved to local storage and populated into shortcut buttons.
